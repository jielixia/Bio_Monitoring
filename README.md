# Bio_Monitoring Interface

This project implements a real-time monitoring interface for physiological signals such as heart rate, breathing, and body movement. 
It is designed to work with a vibration-based sensor system and displays the signals through a responsive graphical interface. (It can be modifed depending on the sensors, here we use a sensor connected via Wifi)
The interface provides controls to display physiological signals in real time, plotted against time (in seconds).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyQtGraph (for real-time signal plotting)
- Custom sensor and data extraction module

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bio_Monitoring.git
cd Bio_Monitoring
pip install pyqtgraph
```
